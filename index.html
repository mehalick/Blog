<p>Hi I'm Andy &mdash; a software developer and owner of <a style="color: #333;" href="http://www.orangejetpackstudios.com">Orange Jetpack Studios</a>, I'm currently living and working in beautiful sunny Kuwait. I am a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer and a recent Master of Software Engineering graduate from Pennsylvania State University.</p>
<p>I have a passion for the elegance inherent in well-designed software solutions and the beauty that exists in the software we create. I enjoy working with and evangelizing all of the technologies and patterns that create harmony in my software development life and I enjoy sharing my experiences of discovery with others.</p>
<p>Currently I build web and native mobile applications of all scale with the ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, SQL Azure, AngularJS, and the Xamarin platform.</p>
