<p>Hi I'm Andy &mdash; I'm currently the CTO of a software services company in beautiful sunny Kuwait.</p> 
<p>I've spent my career as a software engineer and designer and I’ve built and managed teams, led developer training, founded user groups, and presented at conferences.</p>
<p>I have a passion for the elegance inherent in well-designed software solutions and the beauty that exists in the software we create. I enjoy working with and evangelizing all of the technologies and patterns that create harmony in my software development life and I enjoy sharing my experiences with others.</p> 
<p>You’ll currently find me building cloud-native software solutions with Azure and .NET Core.</p>
