While there are lots of fancy and elaborate ways to version ASP.NET apps and their deployments, sometimes I just want an easy way to look at any website and know the codebase Git commit and deployment time. Here's an easy way using Kudu's post deployment actions and Git deployment in an ASP.NET Core app.

We'll be using Git automated deployment orchestrated by Kudu in Azure along with Kudu's [post deployment action hooks](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Post-Deployment-Action-Hooks).

First things first, our ultimate goal will be to create a version.json file at the root of our site with as little or as many details regarding our Git automated deployment as we choose to add. In this example we'll be creating something like:

```json
{
    "DeployUtc":  "2017-04-29 14:11:34Z",
    "ShortHash":  "2ae789e",
    "FullHash":  "2ae789ec8a791a99a5ae40210fd5240a478f2c6c",
    "Subject":  "some commit message here...",
    "Name":  "Andy Mehalick",
    "Email":  "andy.mehalick@orangejetpack.com"
}
```

## Post Deployment Action Hook

While there are a few ways to upload post deployment scripts and/or configure custom locations we'll use a .deployment config to set a location local in our Git repository, this will ensure everything is source controlled. So, we'll create a .deployment file at the root of our repo with a single setting:

```conf
[config]
SCM_POST_DEPLOYMENT_ACTIONS_PATH = deploy\PostDeploymentActions\
```

Next, create PowerShell script deploy\PostDeploymentActions\Set-GitAppVersion.ps1 that Kudu will call after every Git deployment:

```powershell
$o = @{}
$o.DeployUtc = Get-Date -format u;
$o.ShortHash = git.exe log -1 --pretty=format:%h;
$o.FullHash = git.exe log -1 --pretty=format:%H;
$o.Subject = git.exe log -1 --pretty=format:%s;
$o.Name = git.exe log -1 --pretty=format:%cn;
$o.Email = git.exe log -1 --pretty=format:%ce;

$o | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "D:\home\site\wwwroot\version.json";
```

To see everything in action you'll need to set up Git automated deployment using GitHub, Bitbucket, or even Azure directly if you want. Once you're set up and a deployment has been triggered you'll be able to see a log of you post deployment scripts. 

If you're pushing directly to Azure:

Or via the Azure portal, App > Deployment Options > Deployment Details:

Finally, to confirm version.json was created successfully you can connect to your site via FTP or via your Kudu site available at https://{siteName}.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole:

## Reading Deploy File

In our web app I want to embed or show only the Git commit short hash, a.k.a. our "version", and the deployment date and time. To support this let's create a simple model:

```cs
public class AppVersion
{
    public string ShortHash { get; set; } = "000000";
    public DateTime DeployUtc { get; set; } = DateTime.UtcNow;
}
```

Next we'll create a single property service to read and make version.json available to our views:

```cs
public class AppVersionService : IAppVersionService
{
    private readonly IHostingEnvironment _hostingEnvironment;

    public AppVersionService(IHostingEnvironment hostingEnvironment)
    {
        _hostingEnvironment = hostingEnvironment;
    }

    private AppVersion _appVersion;
    public AppVersion AppVersion
    {
        get
        {
            if (_appVersion != null)
            {
                return _appVersion;
            }

            var path = Path.Combine(_hostingEnvironment.WebRootPath, "version.json");
            if (path == null || !File.Exists(path))
            {
                _appVersion = new AppVersion();
            }
            else
            {
                using (var sr = File.OpenText(path))
                {
                    _appVersion = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<AppVersion>(sr.ReadToEnd());
                }
            }

            return _appVersion;
        }
    }
}
```

We're exposing **AppVersion** as a property because we'll configure **AppVersionService** as a singleton in our app's Startup.cs:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...

    services.AddSingleton<IAppVersionService, AppVersionService>();
}
```

## Embedding or Displaying our Version

How or where you embed or display your version details is completely up to you, but I'll provide a few examples. All will exist in _Layout.cshtml and accessed via our AppVersionService exposed with dependency injection:

```cs
@inject IAppVersionService AppVersionService
@{
    var shortHash = AppVersionService.AppVersion;
    var deployUtc = AppVersionService.AppVersion.DeployUtc.ToString("u");
}
```

### JSON Data Blocks

Probably my favorite for embedding:

```html
<script id="version" type="application/json">
    { 
        "ShortHash": "@shortHash",
        "DeployUtc": "@deployUtc"
    }
</script>
```

### HTML5 Data-* Attibutes

Another option would be HTML data-* attributes on the html attribute:

```html
<html data-version-short-hash="@shortHash" data-version-deploy-utc="@deployUtc">
```

### HTML Meta Tags

Or some custom-named meta tags:

```html
<meta name="version:ShortHash" content="shortHash" />
<meta name="version:DeployUtc" content="deployUtc" />
```

### Microdata

If you want to display your version and deployment data perhaps use microdata:

```html
<footer itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/SoftwareApplication">
    &copy; Git App Version Demo | 
    Version: 
        <span itemprop="softwareVersion">@shortHash</span> 
        <time itemprop="startDate" datetime="@deployUtc">@deployUtc</time>
</footer>
```

How you choose to embed or display is really up to how and if you need to read it programmatically and/or your preferences for markup semantics.
